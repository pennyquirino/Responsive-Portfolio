# Responsive-Portfolio

<a href="https://pennyquirino.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/index.html">Click here to see my Responsive Portfolio Project</a>

Create a responsive portfolio update. In this portfolio, the user will be able to view my first project and two exemplary assignments. 
In addition, there must be a way to contact me and a downloadable updated resume. 

There are links to my GitHub profile, this deployed URL, linkedIn, and a little bit about me.


Future work to be done: get a headshot to add some professionalism to this. Make it a bit more robust in coding but still keeping the design clean and simple.
