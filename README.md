Directions
Create three pages titled ("index.html", "portfolio.html", and "contact.html") using Bootstrap and CSS framwork
This project must include - a navbar, responsive images, and a responsive layout
Minimize the use of media queries
The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

Navbar must be consistent on each page and must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

All links must work. Must use semantic html. Must contain your personalized information.
